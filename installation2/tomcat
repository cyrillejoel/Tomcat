In order to use Tomcat's web management interface, you will need to create a user. Open the tomcat-users.xml file with the command:

sudo nano /usr/share/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
Scroll down to below the line which reads <tomcat-users> and add the information for your user account:

<user username="[username]" password="[password]" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>
For example, to add the user jdoe with password En4EW25eI0 this section will read:

<tomcat-users>
<user username="jdoe" password="En4EW25eI0" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>
